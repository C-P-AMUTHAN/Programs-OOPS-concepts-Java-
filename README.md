# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts in Java

This repository contains Java programs that demonstrate essential Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. These programs are designed to help understand how OOP is implemented in Java with real-world examples.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Inheritance**: Demonstrates how subclasses inherit properties and methods from a superclass.
- **Method Overloading**: Shows how methods with the same name can be defined with different parameters.
- **Method Overriding**: Explains how a subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method defined in its superclass.
- **Abstraction**: Demonstrates how to hide complex implementation details and expose only necessary functionality using abstract classes and interfaces.
- **Encapsulation**: Shows how to protect data using private variables and provide access through getter and setter methods.

## Getting Started

To run these programs locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/C-P-AMUTHAN/Programs-OOPS-concepts-Java-.git
